## Why create Been There?:

The world is such a vast and beatiful place to explore. I wanted to create an app that was dedicated to capturing the memories we while exploring. I personally love to go on adventures and seeing all sorts of the things that our world has to offer. I hope this app will allow others to reflect on where they have been and the memories made there!
